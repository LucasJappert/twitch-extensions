## ✨ Features

-   **Visual Schedule Interface**: Displays a visual timeline with activity segments such as _Deep Work_, _Break_, and _Lunch_.
-   **Celebration Effects**: When a segment ends, the site launches confetti 🎊 to motivate you and mark the activity change.
-   **Integrated Alarm**: At the end of each segment, an alarm sounds to notify you it's time to switch tasks.
-   **Current Location and Time**: Shows the current time and location (like Rafaela, Argentina) to keep you aware of the time.
